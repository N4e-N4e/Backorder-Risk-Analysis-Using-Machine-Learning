# Backorder Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project analyzes a Kaggle dataset containing about 1.9 million product records to understand and predict product backorders. Backorders occur when demand exceeds supply, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction, canceled orders, and reduced loyalty. The goal is to identify the key factors that contribute to backorders so companies can better manage inventory without overstocking.

The dataset includes 22 predictors such as current inventory levels, sales history, forecasted demand, recommended stock amounts, and product risk indicators. The target variable indicates whether a product went on backorder.
